 * why a phone still sees every offer instead of a cropped first one.
 *
 * It advances on its own because on a phone only one banner is visible and a
 * static one would hide the rest. It stands down the moment someone touches,
 * hovers or tabs into it: a carousel that moves under a pointer feels broken.
 * There are no arrow buttons — drag, wheel and the dots already cover it.
