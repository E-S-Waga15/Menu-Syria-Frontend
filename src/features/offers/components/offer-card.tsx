/**
 * One offer, everywhere an offer is shown as a card.
 *
 * The whole card is the photograph. What sits on it is arranged by corner so
 * nothing has to compete for the same space: what kind of offer it is reads
 * top-start, what it saves reads top-end, and the foot carries the name with
 * whoever is behind it on one side and the two prices on the other.
 *
 * Two things keep this from repeating the failure it had before. The scrim is
 * a real gradient, dark enough at the foot to carry white type over any
 * photograph rather than hoping the image is dark there. And the card holds
 * its shape without the image: `min-h` backs up the aspect ratio so it can
 * never collapse to its border, and a missing or failed `src` falls back to a
 * tinted panel with the offer mark instead of an empty frame.
